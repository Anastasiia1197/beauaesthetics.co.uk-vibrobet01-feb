                <p class="txt">
                    At <strong>Vibrobet</strong>, we are committed to safeguarding your privacy and maintaining absolute
                    transparency regarding your data. This Cookie Policy explains in clear terms how we use cookies and
                    similar tracking technologies on our website and associated platforms. It is designed to help you,
                    our valued visitor in the <strong>United Kingdom</strong>, understand what information is collected,
                    why it is collected, and how you can maintain full control over your online privacy. We operate in
                    strict accordance with the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) and the Privacy and
                    Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR), ensuring that your experience with us is both secure
                    and respectful of your personal choices. Whether you are accessing our site from England, Scotland,
                    Wales, or Northern Ireland, this policy outlines the same high standard of data protection we apply
                    universally.</p>

                <div class="container__header">
                    <h2>How cookies work on our informational portal</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="txt">
                    Cookies are fundamental to the modern web experience. They are small text files that are downloaded
                    to your device—whether a computer, tablet, or smartphone—when you visit a website. At
                    <strong>Vibrobet</strong>, we utilise these files to remember your actions and preferences over a
                    period of time, so you do not have to re-enter them whenever you come back to the site or browse
                    from one page to another. For instance, essential cookies enable core functionalities such as
                    maintaining your login session, remembering your language preference (ensuring you see content in
                    English), and providing the necessary security to protect your account. Without these strictly
                    necessary cookies, basic functions like navigating between pages or accessing secure areas of our
                    platform would not be possible. We ensure that all cookies deployed are used solely for the purpose
                    of enhancing your interaction with our content about <strong>vibrobet casino online</strong> and
                    related services.

                    <h2>What data we collect and why?</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="txt">
                    We operate on a principle of data minimalism, collecting only the information that is necessary to
                    provide you with a superior and stable informational experience. The data gathered via cookies
                    typically includes technical details about your device and browser, such as your IP address (which
                    is anonymised where possible), browser type, operating system, and the dates and times you access
                    our services. We also collect aggregated, anonymous usage statistics, such as which pages are most
                    frequently visited and how users navigate through our site. This data is invaluable for
                    understanding the interests of our audience in Great Britain, allowing us to refine our content,
                    improve site architecture, and ensure that information about <strong>vibro bet</strong> and the
                    <strong>vibrobet app</strong> is presented in the most accessible way. Importantly, we do not sell
                    your personal data to third parties for any purpose. Any use of your information is strictly for the
                    legitimate interests of improving our platform and communicating with you effectively.
                </p>

                    <h2>External service providers and tracking</h2>
                </div>
                <p class="txt">
                    To enhance our services, we collaborate with carefully selected external partners, such as web
                    analytics providers (for example, Google Analytics). These partners may place their own cookies on
                    your device to help us analyse traffic patterns and measure the performance of our content. We
                    ensure that all such third-party providers are contractually bound to uphold the same rigorous data
                    protection standards that we apply. They are permitted to use your information only on our behalf
                    and for the specific purposes we have instructed, such as compiling reports on website activity. Any
                    tracking conducted by these third parties is done with full respect for your privacy rights and in
                    complete compliance with the UK GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. We regularly review
                    our relationships with these providers to ensure they continue to meet our high expectations for
                    data security and ethical practice, providing peace of mind for all users in the United Kingdom.</p>

                    We firmly believe that you should have the final say over the data stored on your device. Upon your
                    first visit to the <strong>Vibrobet</strong> website, you will be presented with a clear and
                    interactive cookie banner. This tool allows you to selectively accept or reject different categories
                    of cookies—with the exception of strictly necessary ones, which are required for the site to
                    function. You can choose to accept all cookies, reject all non-essential cookies, or customise your
                    preferences by category, such as analytical or marketing cookies. Furthermore, you retain the
                    ability to change your mind at any time. You can adjust your preferences through your browser
                    settings, where you can block or delete cookies already stored on your device. Most browsers also
                    offer a "private" or "incognito" mode that limits the lifespan of cookies. For detailed instructions
                    on managing cookies in your specific browser, you can usually refer to the 'Help' section of that
                    browser. This level of control ensures that your experience with us, whether reading a <strong>vibro
                        bet review</strong> or exploring the features of the <strong>vibrobet casino app</strong>,
                    remains aligned with your personal privacy expectations.</p>
